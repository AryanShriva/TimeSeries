df_tesla=pdr.get_data_yahoo('TSLA')

Will not work anymore as Yahoo has changed its data extraction method.

Use the following command to get the dataframe

!pip install yfinance

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yfin
import pandas_datareader as pdr
yfin.pdr_override()

data = yfin.download('TSLA')
